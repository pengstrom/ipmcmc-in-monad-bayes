    \begin{abstract}
Probabilistic programming shows much promise as a declarative way to define statistical models, but inference is often expensive. A parallelisable particle MMCMC sampler is implemeted in Haskell and the DSL Monad-Bayes. The method shows good performace compared to a single SMC sampler, but the full potential of the method could not be manifested.
