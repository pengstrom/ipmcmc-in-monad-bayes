	abstract = {Machine learning methods extract value from vast data sets quickly and with modest resources. They are established tools in a wide range of industrial applications, including search engines, DNA sequencing, stock market analysis, and robot locomotion, and their use is spreading rapidly. People who know the methods have their choice of rewarding jobs. This hands-on text opens these opportunities to computer science students with modest mathematical backgrounds. It is designed for final-year undergraduates and master's students with limited background in linear algebra and calculus. Comprehensive and coherent, it develops everything from basic reasoning to advanced techniques within the framework of graphical models. Students learn more than a menu of techniques, they develop analytical and problem-solving skills that equip them for the real world. Numerous examples and exercises, both computer based and theoretical, are included in every chapter. Resources for students and instructors, including a MATLAB toolbox, are available online.},

	abstract = {Many real-world data analysis tasks involve estimating unknown quantities from some given observations. In most of these applications, prior knowledge about the phenomenon being modelled is available. This knowledge allows us to formulate Bayesian models, that is prior distributions for the unknown quantities and likelihood functions relating these quantities to the observations. Within this setting, all inference on the unknown quantities is based on the posterior distribution obtained from Bayesâ€™ theorem. Often, the observations arrive sequentially in time and one is interested in performing inference on-line. It is therefore necessary to update the posterior distribution as data become available. Examples include tracking an aircraft using radar measurements, estimating a digital communications signal using noisy measurements, or estimating the volatility of financial instruments using stock market data. Computational simplicity in the form of not having to store all the data might also be an additional motivating factor for sequential methods.},

	abstract = {Gibbs sampling has enormous potential for analysing complex data sets. However, routine use of Gibbs sampling has been hampered by the lack of general purpose software for its implementation. Until now all applications have involved writing one-off computer code in low or intermediate level languages such as C or Fortran. We describe some general purpose software that we are currently developing for implementing Gibbs sampling: BUGS (Bayesian inference using Gibbs sampling). The BUGS system comprises three components: first, a natural language for specifying complex models; second, an 'expert system' for deciding appropriate methods for obtaining samples required by the Gibbs sampler: third, a sampling module containing numerical routines to perform the sampling. \$S\$ objects are used for data input and output. BUGS is written in Modula-2 and runs under both DOS and UNIX.},

	abstract = {Amdahl's law has been widely used by designers and researchers to get a rough estimate of performance improvement when alternate designs and implementations are attempted. It gives a simple relationship between the nature of performance improvement and the problem characteristics. The negative way the original law was stated [Amd67] contributed to a good deal of pessimism about the nature of parallel processing. But, after observing remarkable speedups in some large-scale applications, researchers in parallel processing started wrongfully suspecting the validity and usefulness of Amdahl's law. In this paper we present the many uses of Amdahl's law as well as some of its abuses.},

	abstract = {Some algorithms make critical internal use of updatable state, even though their external specification is purely functional. Based on earlier work on monads, we present a way of securely encapsulating stateful computations that manipulate multiple, named, mutable objects, in the context of a non-strict, purely-functional language. The security of the encapsulation is assured by the type system, using parametricity. Intriguingly, this parametricity requires the provision of a (single) constant with a rank-2 polymorphic type.},
