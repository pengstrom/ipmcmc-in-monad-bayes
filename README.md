# Interacting Particle Inference and Probabilistic Programming in Haskell

Implementation of iPMCMC in the Monad-Bayes Haskell framework.

The folder `thesis` contains the final report, while `presentation` contains the oral presentation and `specification` the initial proposal.

The resulting `Control.Monad.Bayes.Inference.IPMCMC4` module may be found [here](https://github.com/pengstrom/monad-bayes/blob/ipopulation/src/Control/Monad/Bayes/Inference/IPMCMC4.hs).
